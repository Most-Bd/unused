# Unused

This is a website for a second-hand clothing shop (not a real one). It was made using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with typescipt) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in addition to other utility packages (tailwind-scroll-bar, recoil, ...).

[DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/) was used for the products API.
